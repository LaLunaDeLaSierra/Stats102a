## Question 1

a)
```{r}
set.seed(705604096)
gradebook <- data.frame(UID = runif(100, 111111111, 10^9) %/% 1, 
                        Homework_1 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1,
                        Homework_2 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1,
                        Homework_3 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1,
                        Homework_4 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1,
                        Homework_5 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1,
                        Quiz_1 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1,
                        Quiz_2 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1,
                        Quiz_3 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1,
                        Quiz_4 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1,
                        Quiz_5 = runif(100, 0, 100) %/% 1
                        )
print(gradebook)
```

b)
```{r}
gradebook$Homework_4[sample(100, 10)] <- NA
gradebook$Quiz_4[sample(100,10)] <- NA
sum(is.na(gradebook$Homework_4))
sum(is.na(gradebook$Quiz_4))
```

d)

```{r}
messy_impute(gradebook, "mean", 1)
messy_impute(gradebook, "median", 2)
messy_impute(gradebook, "mean", 1, trim = 0.25)
```
e)
```{r, error = TRUE}
gradebook_tidy <- gradebook %>% pivot_longer(c("Homework_1", "Homework_2","Homework_3","Homework_4", "Homework_5","Quiz_1", "Quiz_2","Quiz_3","Quiz_4","Quiz_5"), names_to = "assignment_Type", values_to = "Score" ) %>%
  separate(assignment_Type, into = c("assignmentType","assignmentNumber"))
 gradebook_tidy
```

g)
```{r, error = TRUE}
tidy_impute(gradebook_tidy, "mean", 1)
tidy_impute(gradebook_tidy, "median", 2)
tidy_impute(gradebook_tidy, "mean", 1, trim = 0.25)
```

## Question 2

a)

Three ways in which data might be naturally presented in a messy way include
a weather report over a certain amount of time, hotel booking data, and trending YouTube statistics. These were collected from [link to data](https://analyticsindiamag.com/10-datasets-for-data-cleaning-practice-for-beginners/)

b)
For all of these data sets, you can make use of functions such as pivot_wider(), pivot_longer(), separate(), and unite() amongst others to create tidier data tables that satisfy the three rules for tidy data:
- each variable has its own column
- each observation has its own row
- each value has its own cell
